## Snake Game

Devour apple, grow your snake, and aim for a high score. Avoid walls and yourself to keep the game going. Created with JavaFX to learn GUI basics, this addictive game brings back nostalgia for all. 

## Challenges/Bugs:

1. Developing a game using JavaFX and working with graphical user interfaces posed a considerable challenge due to the lack of prior experience in this area. This was one of the main reasons I decided to make this game was to become better at using JavaFX to build a functional GUI using java.

2. Occasionally, the game abruptly ends without the snake making contact with a wall or colliding with itself. This unpredictability in the game termination needs to be addressed to ensure a smooth and consistent gameplay experience.

3. Apples have been observed to spawn in random locations, as it should, but it sometimes manages to spawn underneath the snake itself. This can lead to situations where the you are running around the board to find the missing apple when it is somewhere underneath the snake.

## Solutions:

These challenges and bugs are easy to fix. The apple situation you would just have to check if the random spot if where part of the snake is, if it is just choose a new spot. The random ending of the game I would have to thing it might just be because the code is un-efficient. 

Since this was just a learning experience on how to use JavaFX I wasnt to focused on the efficiency of the code and little details like the apples becoming underneath the snake.
